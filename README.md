# ML_Rain_Prediction
# Project Objective

The objective of this project is to develop advanced machine learning models capable of accurately predicting rainfall patterns in Sydney using historical weather data. The dataset spans from 2008 to 2017, encompassing various weather-related variables, and the aim is to harness this data to construct robust predictive models.

# Methodology

1. Data Preprocessing:
Encode categorical variables into numerical representations.
Handle missing data by imputing missing values with appropriate statistical measures.
Detect and address outliers in the rainfall data to ensure data integrity.
2. Model Selection:
Employ a diverse set of classification algorithms, including Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost, XGBoost, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Linear Discriminant Analysis.
3. Model Training and Evaluation:
Divide the dataset into training and testing subsets to train and validate each model.
Assess model performance using key metrics such as accuracy, ROC AUC, recall, and precision.
4. Model Comparison:
Compare the performance of different models to identify the most effective one for rainfall prediction.
5. Model Optimization:
Utilize GridSearchCV to fine-tune model hyperparameters, enhancing predictive accuracy and robustness.
